## Problem Identification: The Foundation of Your Startup

### Why It Matters

At the heart of every successful startup is a well-defined problem. Whether you're building a product or offering a service, your goal is to address a real issue faced by people or businesses. You don't need to solve the entire problem, but you should target a significant aspect of it.

### Effective Problem Communication

Being able to clearly explain your problem to anyone, regardless of their background or time constraints, is crucial. Use this template to structure your problem statement:

```
Setting: [Briefly describe the context in 50 characters or less]

Problems:
1. [Concise point - max 7 words]
2. [Concise point - max 7 words]
3. [Concise point - max 7 words]
4. [Concise point - max 7 words]
```

### Guidelines

1. **Setting**: Provide a quick overview of the context or target audience.
2. **Problems**: List up to 4 key issues, each described in 7 words or fewer.
3. **Focus**: Highlight problems that are:
   - Financially impactful
   - Time-consuming
   - Particularly tedious or frustrating

Remember, your startup's success depends on effectively addressing these problems. Take the time to identify and articulate them clearly.
