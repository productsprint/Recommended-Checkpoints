# Recommended Checkpoints

## 1. Problem Identification: The Foundation of Your Product

### Why It Matters

At the heart of every successful startup is a well-defined problem. Whether you're building a product or offering a service, your goal is to address a real issue faced by people or businesses. You don't need to solve the entire problem, but you should target a significant aspect of it.

### Effective Problem Communication

Being able to clearly explain your problem to anyone, regardless of their background or time constraints, is crucial. Use this template to structure your problem statement:

```
Setting: [Briefly describe the context in 50 characters or less]

Problems:
1. [Concise point - max 7 words]
2. [Concise point - max 7 words]
3. [Concise point - max 7 words]
4. [Concise point - max 7 words]
```

### Guidelines

1. **Setting**: Provide a quick overview of the context or target audience.
2. **Problems**: List up to 4 key issues, each described in 7 words or fewer.
3. **Focus**: Highlight problems that are:
   - Financially impactful
   - Time-consuming
   - Particularly tedious or frustrating

Remember, your startup's success depends on effectively addressing these problems. Take the time to identify and articulate them clearly.

## 2. Audience Profiling: Crafting Your User Thesis
### Why It Matters
Understanding your target audience is crucial, even at this stage. While you may not have extensive data, developing a preliminary user thesis helps focus your efforts and guides initial product development.

### User Thesis Template
Create a concise profile of your hypothetical user (_the point descriptors are simply suggestions_):
```
Primary User:
1. [Demographic trait]
2. [Behavioral characteristic]
3. [Pain point]
4. [Goal or aspiration]
5. [Tech-savviness level]
6. [Purchasing power/decision-making role]
```

### Guidelines
1. **Be specific**: Avoid generic descriptions.
2. **Stay focused**: Limit to 6 points, 5 words each.
3. **Base on research**: Use available data or observations.
4. **Consider extremes**: Think about power users and novices.
5. **Align with problem**: Ensure user profile matches identified issues.

Remember, this profile is a starting point. You'll refine it as you gather more information and interact with actual users during the validation phase.

## 3. Utopian Features: Envisioning Your Product's Future

### Why It Matters
Imagining the most ambitious version of your product can inspire creativity, drive motivation, and set long-term goals (_Imagination limit: within 2 years_). While not all features may be immediately achievable, they provide a roadmap for future development and help prioritize your efforts.

### Utopian Feature Template
List 10 ambitious features for your product, ordered by priority of user-utility (_not technically most prioritized_):

```
1. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
2. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
3. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
4. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
5. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
6. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
7. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
8. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
9. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
10. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
```

### Guidelines
1. **Think big**: Don't limit yourself to current technological constraints.
2. **Stay relevant**: Ensure features align with your core problem and user needs.
3. **Balance innovation and feasibility**: Aim for ambitious yet potentially achievable ideas.
4. **Consider scalability**: Think about how features could grow with your user base.
5. **Prioritize impact**: Order features based on potential value to users and your business.

Remember, these utopian features set a vision for your product's future. Use them to guide your long-term strategy as you develop your initial MVP.

\* P.S. Prioritize based on problem-solving impact and user value. Do not prioritize based on technical complexity, ease of implementation, or "coolness factor". Avoid giving precedence to features that rely heavily on network effects or social proof before establishing a user base. Focus on core functionalities that directly address your identified problem.

## 4. Minimum Viable Features: Pruning To Your Core Product

### Why It Matters
Identifying your Minimum Viable Features (MVF) or Minimum Sellable Features (MSF) is crucial for launching quickly and efficiently. These core features allow you to enter the market, start collecting users, and gather valuable feedback without overcomplicating your initial product.

### MVF/MSF Template
List at most 3 core features (stick to 3, the less the better) that form the foundation of your minimum viable product:

```
1. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
   - Key benefit: [One sentence explaining the main user value]
   - Implementation priority: [High/Medium/Low]

2. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
   - Key benefit: [One sentence explaining the main user value]
   - Implementation priority: [High/Medium/Low]

3. [Feature name]: [Brief description - max 10 words]
   - Key benefit: [One sentence explaining the main user value]
   - Implementation priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### Guidelines
1. **Focus on essentials**: Choose features that directly address your core problem.
2. **Prioritize user value**: Select features that provide immediate benefits to early adopters.
3. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex features that could delay your launch.
4. **Consider feasibility**: Ensure these features can be developed with your current resources.

Remember, your MVP is just the starting point. These core features should allow you to enter the market quickly and start gathering real-world feedback for future iterations.
