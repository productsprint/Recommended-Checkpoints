## 1. Problem Identification: The Foundation of Your Product

### Why It Matters

At the heart of every successful startup is a well-defined problem. Whether you're building a product or offering a service, your goal is to address a real issue faced by people or businesses. You don't need to solve the entire problem, but you should target a significant aspect of it.

### Effective Problem Communication

Being able to clearly explain your problem to anyone, regardless of their background or time constraints, is crucial. Use this template to structure your problem statement:

```
Setting: [Briefly describe the context in 50 characters or less]

Problems:
1. [Concise point - max 7 words]
2. [Concise point - max 7 words]
3. [Concise point - max 7 words]
4. [Concise point - max 7 words]
```

### Guidelines

1. **Setting**: Provide a quick overview of the context or target audience.
2. **Problems**: List up to 4 key issues, each described in 7 words or fewer.
3. **Focus**: Highlight problems that are:
   - Financially impactful
   - Time-consuming
   - Particularly tedious or frustrating

Remember, your startup's success depends on effectively addressing these problems. Take the time to identify and articulate them clearly.

## 2. Audience Profiling: Crafting Your User Thesis
### Why It Matters
Understanding your target audience is crucial, even at this stage. While you may not have extensive data, developing a preliminary user thesis helps focus your efforts and guides initial product development.

### User Thesis Template
Create a concise profile of your hypothetical user (_the point descriptors are simply suggestions_):
```
Primary User:
1. [Demographic trait]
2. [Behavioral characteristic]
3. [Pain point]
4. [Goal or aspiration]
5. [Tech-savviness level]
6. [Purchasing power/decision-making role]
```

### Guidelines
1. **Be specific**: Avoid generic descriptions.
2. **Stay focused**: Limit to 6 points, 5 words each.
3. **Base on research**: Use available data or observations.
4. **Consider extremes**: Think about power users and novices.
5. **Align with problem**: Ensure user profile matches identified issues.

Remember, this profile is a starting point. You'll refine it as you gather more information and interact with actual users during the validation phase.
